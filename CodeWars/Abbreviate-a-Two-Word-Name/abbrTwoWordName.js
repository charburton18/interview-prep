function abbrevName(name) {

}

/*
Restate:
Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.
The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.
It should look like this (see Examples)

My Questions:
What is the input? A string with only one space in it (between letters)
What is the output? A string consisting of a capital letter, a dot, another capital letter
What should the function do?
- Define the first letter as firstInitial
- Define the letter after the space as lastInitial
- use toUppercase() on the first letter and the first letter after the space
- return the two upper-cased letter with a '.' in between them

Examples:
Sam Harris => S.H
patrick feeney => P.F
a b => A.B
